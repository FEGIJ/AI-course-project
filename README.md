# Piano Solo Generator

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This AI should help pianist to develop their solo skills by analyzing solos from recordings by great pianists and both transcribe and suggest new ideas. By listen, transcribe and analyze phrases, scales, rythms and harmonization, the AI can generate transcribtions in sheet music and create licks in a given tune, e.g. d-minor. 

## Background

Learn to play improvised piano solos that sounds great is really hard and time consuming. It always tends to sound simplistic anc childish compared to the great masters. The idea is to use AI as a learning tool with real examples and explanations on what harmonization and scales are used in specific solos as an inspiration to improve the own technique. Hopefully inspirational and a way to learn faster that also can be used while learning new songs.   


## How is it used?

* The user can provide famous solos and get them transcribed into sheet music and get them analyzed
* The user can give a specific key and style (e.g. d-minor as Bud Powell) and get solo licks back for inspiration.
* AI could create own solos based on deep learning of great masters solos.
* Could be used to study but also for active musicians that are learning new tunes and need inspiration on that specific tunes chord progression and key alternations.

## Data sources and AI methods
AI should be trained on recordings from open sources or your own library. Midi and notation software may be required to create sheet music. MIR (Music Information Retrieval) could be used to identify scales, rythms and phrases. Machine Learing and Neural Networks could be used to analyse and generate music

## Challenges

The copyright of recorded material may be a problem if not onlys using it on your own music library for own purposes. Maybe only old music could be used. Maybe it should first be focused on transcriptions of recorded music into score, then it could train on printed music and audio files. 

## What next?

This is unfortunately beyond my own technical skills, but the help of someone used to work with sound recognition and music would be a great start.
